# Research-on-Non-contact-Heart-Rate-Measurement-Based-on-Facial-Video
The project, funded by the National Undergrad Innovation Training Program, aims to research non-contact heart rate measurement within a year. It utilizes device cameras (e.g., computers, smartphones) to extract facial video light signals, analyze them, and determine real-time heart rates based on Imaging Photoplethysmography (IPPG).
